    X13 algorithm
    ~110k Coin Proof-of-Work (PoW) Maximum*
    0.1% Premine
    6 Day Maximum Proof-of-Work (PoW) Mining Phase*

    9.4% Proof-of-Stake (PoS)*

*Note: PoS begins immediately and therefore the number coins and the time until PoW mining is done will very likely be less than the stated maximums.
